# Where I can improve and what I've learnt

I can deff improve in learning how to use the terminal more, other than using it for github, I feel like i don't use it as much as i should for npms and installing tools. But i have learnt how to use the terminal more regardless. I'm also a lot more confident on how to use tailwind and feel like i can confidently make my own personal playground websites using it now that i understand how it works.
